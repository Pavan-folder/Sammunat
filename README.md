# Sammunat — Landing Page

This is a clean, responsive React landing page for Sammunat built with Vite.

Quick start

Install and run locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Deploy

1. Create a GitHub repository and push this project (see commands below).
2. Deploy to Vercel or Netlify (both have free tiers). Connect your GitHub repo and follow their UI.

Example Git commands:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Sammunat landing page"
# create repo on GitHub, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/sammunat-landing.git
git push -u origin main
```

If you want, I can create the GitHub repo and attempt a deploy (requires your GitHub/Vercel auth).
